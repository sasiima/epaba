1.       Need to figure out the linear expression. In this case, it is going to be:
1.1.    Insurance Coverage(Y) = B0+B1Age+B2Time+B3Insured+B4Insurance Type+B5Race+B6State
2.       There are going to be number of observations:
2.1.    Age : Under 18, 18 to 40, 40 to 50, 50 to 65
2.2.    Time span : 2006 to 2018
2.3.    Insured: Insured / Uninsured
2.4.    Insurance Type*
2.5.    State: Number of states present
2.6.    Race: Different Types of Race*
3.       Need to keep the parameter Age and time and plot the insurance coverage against other remaining parameters
4.       Need to check the outliers in Response as well as Predictor variables
5.       Use of Hadiâ€™s Influence Measure, to check the outliers
6.       If the outliers are present, need to check whether we can leave it out or have to include them
7.       Need to check the heteroscadasticity, by check the least square method
8.       Need to transform the equation and check it again
9.       Check the collinearity 
10.   Check seasonality
11.   Use Arima and find the best fitted model with small AIC
